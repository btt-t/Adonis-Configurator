## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this plugin in the form of a pull request. 

I don't think I need to elaborate much on what is allowed - just make sure that **you test your changes before you submit them** and that your submissions are sufficiently relevant and add value to the experience of this plugin. 

As for what isn't permitted, you should most certainly avoid submitting obfuscated code. Don't send in anything that violates Roblox's TOS or Community Rules either. I also ask that your code is clean - I will not merge code that is messy or cluttered, except where it is unavoidable.

Please note that all assets must be housed in the Assets folder and stored in the .rbxmx file type.
