# Adonis Configurator
It's not entirely unexpected for someone to be unfamiliar with Luau syntax. This plugin aims to eliminate that hassle entirely, instead employing a GUI for installation and configuration.

# Installation
The average user should just click [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/8359267635/Adonis-Configurator) and install the plugin from Roblox.

You may also head [here](https://github.com/happyman090/Adonis-Configurator/releases) (the releases page) to download the version of your choice and install that (I have no idea why you would want to do that, but it's an option anyway).

If you would like to use the bleeding edge version of Adonis Configurator, you should compile it yourself using Rojo:

`rojo build /path/to/Adonis-Configurator -o AdonisConfigurator.rbxm`
