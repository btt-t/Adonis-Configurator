# Adonis Configurator

It's not entirely unexpected for someone to be unfamiliar with Luau syntax. This plugin aims to eliminate that hassle entirely, instead employing a GUI for installation and configuration.

## Installation

The average user should just click [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/8359267635/Adonis-Configurator) and install the plugin from Roblox.

You may also head [here](https://github.com/happyman090/Adonis-Configurator/releases) (the releases page) to download the version of your choice and install that (I have no idea why you would want to do that, but it's an option anyway).

If you would like to use the bleeding edge version of Adonis Configurator, you should compile it yourself using Rojo:

`rojo build /path/to/Adonis-Configurator -o AdonisConfigurator.rbxm`

## Notes

This is still a WIP with quite a few critical features that are currently missing. I would like to add:
- a way to specify a loader's location (currently just looks for Adonis_Loader in ServerScriptService)
- a description to each property so the user knows what a property is for
- a formatting guide somewhere inside the plugin (this may be in the form of advising the user what a value should look like when entering text input)

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute in the form of a pull request. I don't think I need to elaborate much on what is allowed - just make sure that **you test your changes before you submit them** and that your submissions are sufficiently relevant and add value to the experience of this plugin.
